This is a personal project I developed to address the lack of cost-free, ad-free flashcard apps! You can run this using the steps below. Then enter edit mode to add/delete flashcards, or study mode to test out your knowledge!

## Getting Started

To use this app,

1. Clone this repo
2. run npm install to install dependencies
3. run npm run dev to run the dev server
4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the result.

## In Progress

This project is currently in progress. Next steps include:

1. Host on AWS to save flashcards between sessions.
2. Add editing for current flashcards without deleting them.
3. Add user configurability for recommender system.
